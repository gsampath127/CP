These samples are randomly generated from Visual Studio using the schema. Please note the following when reviewing them.

1. Data is randomly generated and does not match any valid client, vertical market, or system data.
2. The data generated will most likely NOT meet complex restrictions such as pattern restrictions. This data will of course show up as invalid when loading in Visual Studio.
3. The samples will not necessarily contain all local elements (child elements of global elements, or 3rd generation).
4. The samples will contain the root element and all global elements (child elements of the root, or 2nd generation).
5. Global elements that have no attributes, only optional sequence of child elements, may just be closed without any children when the sample xml is large.
6. Most unbound sequences will contain 3 children, and 3 nested levels for recursive and/or complex hierarchies.

Thank you!
